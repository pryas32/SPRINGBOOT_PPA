input devices-> the devices through which we give input to the computer are know as input devices
eg ->mouse,keyword
outpout devices-> the devices through which computer gives us an output eg printer

scanner act as both input as well as output devices

cpu->central process unit-used for compoutation purpose
memory->used for storing the data
cache-> used for frequrent usage of the data
main memory->volatile-> ram-> our computer reads data from main menor ie ram
secondary memory->rom this act as permamnent storage->non volatilr memory 
why do we have three kinds of memory
becuse kles qacces time 
cap[acity and cost
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         ]
for a software to run its bought into the main memory from secondary storage and then executed by cpu step by step\
operating system act as a maneger of the computer
it help in interaction of the input & outpout devices and secondary storage with cpu and main memory
cpu help in computation in  faster manner we need programming language to interact with cpu as cpu understand 0's and 1's
programming languages like c++ ,java they have software like compiler and intrerpreter they help to convert the high level languages like C++,java into low lecvel langage which computer can understand
compiler->it compiles the whole code into low level binary file.
while interpter read the code line by line


java is a platform independent .it was built in 1995.
when we compile the java code it get converted into the bytecode which can run on any platform .That platform need to have jvm preinstalled on it
for C/C++ they are not platform dependent because on compilation they generate executable format whcih is different for diffenet platform
for running on different platform you need to have compiler of that platform installed in it.
java has simple compilation and complex running code 
while C++ has complex compilation as they need to generate machine specific binary code


advantage of java over c++
secure
platform indepdenct
pointers no use


java is similiar to C++ means statically types means need to declare variable
