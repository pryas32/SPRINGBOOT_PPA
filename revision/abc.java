input devices-> the devices through which we give input to the computer are know as input devices
eg ->mouse,keyword
outpout devices-> the devices through which computer gives us an output eg printer
scanner act as both input as well as output devices

cpu->central process unit-used for compoutation purpose
memory->used for storing the data
cache-> used for frequrent usage of the data
main memory->volatile-> ram-> our computer reads data from main menor ie ram
secondary memory->rom this act as permamnent storage->non volatilr memory 
why do we have three kinds of memory
becuse kles qacces time 
cap[acity and cost
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         ]
for a software to run its bought into the main memory from secondary storage and then executed by cpu step by step\
operating system act as a maneger of the computer
it help in interaction of the input & outpout devices and secondary storage with cpu and main memory
cpu help in computation in  faster manner we need programming language to interact with cpu as cpu understand 0's and 1's
programming languages like c++ ,java they have software like compiler and intrerpreter they help to convert the high level languages like C++,java into low lecvel langage which computer can understand
compiler->it compiles the whole code into low level binary file.
while interpter read the code line by line


java is a platform independent .it was built in 1995.
when we compile the java code it get converted into the bytecode which can run on any platform .That platform need to have jvm preinstalled on it
for C/C++ they are not platform dependent because on compilation they generate executable format whcih is different for diffenet platform
for running on different platform you need to have compiler of that platform installed in it.
java has simple compilation and complex running code 
while C++ has complex compilation as they need to generate machine specific binary code


advantage of java over c++
secure
platform indepdenct
pointers no use


java is similiar to C++ means statically types means need to declare variable

java has automatic garbage collection we need not to explicitdly deallocate dynamic memory

//every code that we write in java has to be part of some class
public class abc{statoc so that its object cant be created void retun type
    main-> this is from where the execuition of the pgrm begins
    public static void main(((


    )String args[])//it takes array of string as an argument
        so that it can be accesible out siode the class when jvm compiles it outide the pkg
        public  
    }
    
    
    jvm-> java virtual machine->it is used for converting bytecode into machine specific binary code
    jdk->it is an open source provided by oracle for java programming)

jdk has jre and java class librares-> they are standard librares useed for running java pgrm
jvm->used for converting bytecode into machine specific binary code
dev tools-> these are the tools required for java programming eg java debugger
javac test
java test

vairable and data type
variable ->used for storing the value
data type-> it tell who much memory memory is allocated to that vairable

boolean-T| F
1 byte->8 bit(-2^7 tio 2^7-1)
short-> 2-> 16 but (-2^15 to 2^15-1)
int->4 byte(-2^31 to 2^31-1)
long->8 byte(-2^63 to 2^63-1)
float and double
char(0 to 2^16-1)

we can have variable name no like this->0a ,1-9a,_a
a!, a# ||a else if keyword cant be used as variale name
